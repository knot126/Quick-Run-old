# QuickRun: How to relase

WIP Document

## ZIP files

Currently, I plan to use ZIP files to distribute assets and binaries. Assets will get their own folder for each release, and binaries for diffrent systems will be split into their own ZIP files. Each release will have two ZIP files: assets and binaries.

I'm not sure if the ZIP files will be extracted or mounted by the launcher, but I'd like to mount them from the launcher for easier distribution.
